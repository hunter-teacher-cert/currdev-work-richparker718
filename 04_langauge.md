What is the course? (grade level, student experience)

The course is APCS Principles. The students typically enrolled in the class are freshman and/or sophmores. The students in the class may have had a prior computer science course using Scratch or some other blocked-based language, but generally speaking the course is their first CS course as well as their first AP course as well.



What is the language?

The programming language is Snap, a blocked-based language.



How does one write & run code in this language?

One doesn’t write the language but rather drag and connect blocks together to create scripts/algorithms. 



Rate the complexity of the syntax?

I would rate the syntax as very easy to write/compose as it related to Scratch, another language created to introduce students to coding in an attainable method. You typically don’t get error messages unless for example - the block is expecting a list and a user inputs a number. 



Strengths:

Ease to compose a simple program 
Allows different levels of students to feel success
Mininal syntax errors
It’s a very visual language
Color-coated blocks help students locate the blocks they need
Block shapes differ, i.e. reporter blocks are oval, predicate or boolean value blocks are diamond-shaped  



How would you utlilize the strengths in the class?

I would utilize the strengths of the language to help students feel successful and not intimidated by the complexity of CS. For advanced/proficient students, I would create challenges or tiered-levels as to show them that although Snap is a blocked-based language, one can compose advanced projects.



Weaknesses:

The fact that the APCS Principles exam doesn’t use block-based code.
Some students may not feel like they’re realling coding because of the blocks.
Having to translate the blocks into psuedocode to prepare the students for the APCS Principles exam.
The BJC curriculum is not aligned with the CS Principles exam in the same way that you see CS A curriculums aligned with the CS exam.



How would you mitigate the weaknesses in the class?

I would mitigate the weaknesses by consistently showing how code created using Snap would translate into the pseudocode they would see on the exam.
I would have students write pseudocode throughout the year to prepare them for the exam.
I would utilize College Board’s practice questions to make sure throughout the year students are seeing exam-like questions.



Why did you select this language for this class?

I selected this language for the class because I teach at Title 9 school and many students have not been exposed to CS in a meaningful way and in my opinion, block-based languages are good for inexperienced students.
