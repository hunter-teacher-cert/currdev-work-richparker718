9-12.IC.2

Debate laws and
regulations that impact
the development and
use of computing
technologies and digital
information. 

The focus is on developing
and defending a claim
about how a specific law
related to computing
technologies impacts
different stakeholders.


A lesson that could be developed from this standard involes Section 203 of the Communications Decency Act. In such a hyper-polarized society, having students look at how laws that sheild creators of technology can ultimately lead to creating a dystopian society where norm-breaking becomes routine. 

Possible essential Questions can be raised and developed by students:
1. Should tech companies that publish user content be held to some kind of standard to dissuade mis/dis information?
2. What is the line between free speech and misinformation?
3. Should the Internet be more regulated? And if so, would that impede the growth of the "free Internet?"

The idea is to have a team(s) of students develop questions and participate in a debate against another team(s).


9-12.IC.4
Assess personal and
societal trade-offs
related to computing
technologies and data
privacy. 

The focus is on discussing
the personal and societal
benefits and drawbacks of
different types of data
collection and use, in
terms of ethics, policy, and
culture. 


A lesson or activity that could be developed from this standard is exploring the idea of what do you consent to when you download an app and how is that data used by the tech company. Do you know what you've consented to? - this is the essential question of the activity. The activity would start with a survey of the most downloaded apps of the students. Once we've realized the top three, research the privacy or data policies associated with those apps. As the class highlights key policies, refer the class back to the essential questions. The exercise could continue to develop by exploring the idea of "data privacy advocates"
