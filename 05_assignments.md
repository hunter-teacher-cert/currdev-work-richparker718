Lesson 1 Description: Students have been programming in Snap all year and after the AP exam I want to transition them to text based programming. It is important for students to make the connection that they already know how to do a lot and what we’re going to do is like translating from one language to another. This lesson will be part of a larger unit that will focus on Sequence, Selection and Iteration. The goal is to convert labs or projects that students did in Snap to Python.

Warm up Question: How do you say ‘Hello’ in at least 3 different languages? (you can use the Internet)

To Students: Learning a new programming language is not as difficult as learning to say Hello in different languages because programming languages have more similarities than differences. Different programming languages include things like Conditionals and “if statements” and “for loops” but the way we write them to execute may be slightly different. Going from Snap to text is a little different because of the difference between dragging blocks and writing but in time you’ll get it.

Lesson Objective: Students will view Snap scripts/blocks that they are familiar with and translate them into Python code, compile and display results. Students will start with simple expressions and ‘if’ statements.


Student Instructions:
View the short video on printing statements in Python 
Go to the website Pythontutor.com, print your name and class schedule (periods 1-8)
Respond to the class poll indicating that you’ve completed the task
We will view selected responses and discuss

Lesson 2 Description: (This lesson is not sequential with lesson 1. At this point in the unit, students have created Replit accounts) As we transition to text based coding, this lesson and others in the unit will address the fact that students are used to the highly visual aspect of Snap. For example, The “ask” block is used exclusively to take typed input from the user. Eventhough typing code makes students feel like they’re programming, allowing students to feel the visual aesthetic of their code is important. In this lesson students will use Tkinter to recreate the experience they’re familiar with of text boxes popping on the screen, taking input and reporting some result.


Warm up Question: In Snap, how did we take input from the user and how was their answer stored?

To Students: When programming in Snap, we used the ‘ask’ block to take in input from the user and store it in the variable answer. This idea became essential to many of labs/programs, without the ask any program requiring a typed response would not work without it. Being able to take input from a user is important in any programming language not just Snap. Over the next few lessons, we will focus on taking input from the user, storing the answer in a variable and using it in a script.

Lesson Objective: Students will begin to start working with and learning about creating widgets.

Student Instructions: 
View the video on creating an interface window widget 
Using Replit, set a root widget
Create a label widget and print something to the root widget
