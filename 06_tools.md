I use Nearpod in my classroom. The general purpose of the tool is to present media-rich lessons to students. I’ve used Nearpod for a couple of years now and find that it encompasses aspects from many other similar platforms/tech tools. 

With Nearpod, I can makes slides, give quizzes, take polls, integrate questions into a video, create a collaboration board, create a “king of the mountain” type of quiz game. All-in-all, I find it to be very useful in supporting any textbook/curriculum being used to teach. 

As far as how I use it, generally speaking, I use it at the beginning of a Unit and/or for any topic that students are struggling with. I also use it for students who miss class as a way to make up work from home.

 I selected Nearpod partly because my school or maybe the entire DOE, has an account setup with the company. I think I started using it sometime during Covid, but whenever I did start, I’ve used it ever since.

A tool that I use as well is Google Classroom. Google Classroom is been a default-like tech tool since the pandemic although I’ve been using it for years. GC is my default gradebook as the DOE Grades app has been a bit of a disaster. 

The DOE app is cumbersome and most students/parents haven’t been able to navigate it in a meaningful way to the point where many students in my school had no idea whether they were passing or failing if their teacher wasn’t a GC user. 

I use GC in all my classes as students are able to see posted assignments as well as being able to see their averages and standing in the class. I post assignments on GC, grade assignments, post and categorize all materials. I find GC invaluable for keeping students and parents up-to-date on their progress.
