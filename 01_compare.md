Compare the curriculum for a CS class you currently/will/have recently taught with a pre-packaged curriculum for the same course (or a course with similar focus).
If you teach CSA or CSP, you could use a different version of that course.
For other courses, look around for pre-packaged courses with similar aims. Many of the Curriculum providers we looked at for AP CSP also provide intro courses at the least.
Alternatively: Elementary school teachers that cannot find anything similar to compare to, or masters students may opt to compare two of the APCSP curricula that were linked in the Async portion of the assignment.
Focus on the following:
Major differences
Major similiarities
Comparative streangths & weaknesses (That is does one cover a topic paticularly better/worse over the other. If both seem euqlly good then no need to comment).
Would you adopt anything from the curriculum you do not teach into your class if you could? Why?


Responses:
Differences - I currently teach APCS Principles using the BJC curriculum. From reading the syllabus overview of CS50, the major differences that standout is the transition of from blocks to text based programming.
Most CS Principles courses I've viewed either do one or the other, I've never seen the combining of both. I know on code.org you can toggle between both but even so, CS50 uses Scratch, C and Python.
Another difference I see is that the teaching of data types is done in C and the focus on block programming is very introductory.

Similarities - I don't know if there are major similarities as the block based programming is Chapter 0 and then the course immediately goes into text based. The similarity comes from the covering the ethical concerns 
of computing. Here, the curriculum looks similar to what you will see exploring BJC. Also, the Tech Spotlight reminds me of the old explore task that used to be part of the exam
where students have to write about a technology.

Comparative - I think a strength of CS50 is its ambition - to take students from scratch to C and Python. Students will be exposed to a lot of concepts and practical applications
by programmming in different languages which will be helpful if a student decides to explore CS more in-depth. I like the way code.org and BJC explore the Internet better 
than CS50 from what I can tell. CS50 seems to include the Internet in its hardware chapter versus having a stand-alone chapter for the Internet. I think the curriculum 
is catered to the student going to a prestigious school like Harvard and not the average NYC Public School student.
