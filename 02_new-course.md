Course Name:

Sound and Media Explorations using p5


Description:

I’m just being introduced to p5 so I can’t speak in-depth but the class would use the p5 library to go beyond the limits of GarageBand or Logic for music and media classes. Students currently at my school get a chance to program using browser-based programs where they drag and drop/ mix and match sound files. Students have to match key signatures as well as account for tempo and other stylistic choices. Using p5 students will be able to explore those concepts in a much more dynamic way by being able to infuse more media in combination with the music component. I can imagine a unit on using the oscillators to make a music tuner which is a tool musicians use all of the time. Target audience would be students in the school involved in arts, science and media.This course would fit in along with the arts and media department as my school offers AP Music and AP Studio Art where students can be uniquely creative in their AP Projects. I would imagine that this course would fit well with physics as well and of course would also support the CS program.
